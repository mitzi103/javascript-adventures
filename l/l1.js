/* Create a javascript array of the format
    [1,2,3,4]
    Running l1.js should output in the above format in the console.
    use a variable to store this array 
 */

 var array = ['keyboard', 'mouse','pen','pencil'];
 console.log(array);
/* answer is correct */

/*
1) rename the array variable to a meaningful name,
as its contents hold a set of similar items.
The name array is too general once your code becomes complex
2) Add a single line comment to the console.log line so that it wont be executed anymore,
but it will be still in the source code.
3) Now we need to print the array items one after the other one items per line
eg: 
keyboard
mouse
..and so forth
